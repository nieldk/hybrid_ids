# Hybrid Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in Python

A real-time Intrusion Detection System built in Python using both **signature-based detection** and **machine learning-based anomaly detection**.

## Features

- Real-time packet sniffing using Scapy
- Signature-based alerts for suspicious IPs and ports
- Anomaly detection with Isolation Forest (Scikit-learn)
- Terminal alerts with timestamps and colorized output
- Easily extendable and modular Python code

## Demo

## Installation
